Task 7 – SPECKit Plus (AIDD 30-Day Challenge)

 SPECKit Plus:
 
SPECKit Plus is a simple framework that helps us understand how to plan, design, and complete AI or software projects step by step. It breaks the whole process into clear stages so that we can think better, stay organized, and implement our ideas in a structured way. By following SPECKit Plus, students learn how to define a problem, plan a solution, create tasks, and finally implement the project smoothly.

Five Core Concepts of SPECKit Plus
1 /constitution

The constitution section explains the main purpose and values of a project. It tells why the project exists and what problems it aims to solve. It sets the foundation and gives direction to the whole project.

2 /specify

In this part, we define the exact requirements of the project. We write what the system should do, what features it needs, and what the final result should look like. This helps remove confusion and makes everything clear before starting.

3 /plan

Planning is about organizing the work in a smart way. Here we create a roadmap, decide the steps we will follow, choose the tools we will use, and set deadlines. A good plan helps us complete the project on time.

4 /tasks

This section breaks the project into small, manageable tasks. Each task has a clear objective so that team members know exactly what to do. Dividing work into tasks makes the project easier to handle and track.

5 /implement

This is the stage where we actually build the project. We write the code, create the features, and bring the plan to life. It is the final step where ideas turn into a working solution.
